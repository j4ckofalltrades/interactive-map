# Interactive map template

Get started with visualizations by building an interactive map that plots points from a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) dataset.

Built using [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), and [mapLibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js).

## Quickstart

Start the app by running `npm start`.

The sample dataset contains a single point which is plotted as a red circle in the map, which displays a popup when clicked.
Add more points to the [dataset](./dataset) to see how they look like in the map, and play around with the code in [index.ts](./src/index.ts).
